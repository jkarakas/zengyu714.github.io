## Variables are labels

The right-hand side is where the object is created or retrieved **first**.
Then the variable on the left is bound to the object, like a **label** stuck to it.


```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
a.append(4)
b
```




    [1, 2, 3, 4]



### `is` operator and `id` function


```python
a is b
```




    True




```python
id(a), id(b)
```




    (2148977200840, 2148977200840)



### `is not` operator


```python
c = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```


```python
c == a
```




    True




```python
c is not a
```




    True



### `is` versus `==`

`==`
+ compares the **values(data)** of objects
+ `a == b` is syntactic sugar for `a.__eq__(b)`, which is overriden mostly,
    hence generates more meaningful comparison rather than object IDs
+ is used more frequently

`is`
+ compares the `id()` identities
+ checks whether a variable is bound to `None`



## Shallow copy

A shallow copy of a collection is a copy of the collection **structure**, not the elements.
With a shallow copy, two collections now **share** the individual elements.

### `list()` and `l2 = l1[:]`

`list(l1)` creates a copy of l1
`l2 = l1[:]` makes a copy too, for lists and other mutable sequences


```python
l1 = [1,2,(3,4)]
l2 = list(l1)
l2
```




    [1, 2, (3, 4)]



the contents are equal


```python
l2 == l1
```




    True



but refer to two different objects


```python
l2 is l1
```




    False



### Interactive animation at the [Online Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/)


```python
l1 = [1, 2, (3, 4, 5), [6, 7]]
l2 = list(l1)
```


```python
l1.append(8)        # has no effect on l2
l1[3].remove(7)     # both remove 7, refers to the same list [6, 7]

print("l1:{}\nl2:{}".format(l1,l2))

l2[3] +=[7, 8]      # changes the list in place
l2[2] +=(5.1, 5.2)  # += on tuple creates a new tuple

print("l1:{}\nl2:{}".format(l1,l2))
```

    l1:[1, 2, (3, 4, 5), [6], 8]
    l2:[1, 2, (3, 4, 5), [6]]
    l1:[1, 2, (3, 4, 5), [6, 7, 8], 8]
    l2:[1, 2, (3, 4, 5, 5.1, 5.2), [6, 7, 8]]


### KEYNOTE
---
1. Copies are shallow by default, like using the constructor or `[:]`.
2. Shallow copy saves memory if all items are **immutable**.

## Deep copy

A deep copy of a collection is two collections with **all of the elements** in the original collection duplicated

### `copy()` and `deepcopy()`


```python
class Bus:

    def __init__(self, passengers=None):
        if passengers is None:
            self.passengers = []
        else:
            self.passengers = list(passengers)

    def pick(self, name):
        self.passengers.append(name)

    def drop(self, name):
        self.passengers.remove(name)
```


```python
import copy
bus1 = Bus(list('abcd'))
bus2 = copy.copy(bus1)
bus3 = copy.deepcopy(bus1)
id(bus1), id(bus2), id(bus3)
```




    (1682463090448, 1682463090560, 1682463090728)



`copy` and `deepcopy` create three distinct `Bus` instances


```python
bus1.drop('d')
bus2.passengers
```




    ['a', 'b', 'c']



`copy()` method is shallow copy


```python
id(bus1.passengers), id(bus2.passengers), id(bus3.passengers)
```




    (1682463018568, 1682463018568, 1682463059848)




```python
bus3.passengers
```




    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']



`deepcopy()` behaves as its name`

## Parameters passed by references ONLY

### A function could change mutable parameters


```python
def func(a, b):
    a += b
    return a
```

#### integer x is unchanged


```python
x = 1
y = 2
func(x, y)
```




    3




```python
x, y
```




    (1, 2)



#### list a is changed


```python
a = [1, 2]
b = [3, 4]
func(a, b)
```




    [1, 2, 3, 4]




```python
a, b
```




    ([1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4])



#### tuple t is unchanged


```python
t = (1, 2)
u = (3, 4)
func(t, u)
```




    (1, 2, 3, 4)




```python
t, u
```




    ((1, 2), (3, 4))



### ~~Mutable types as parameters DEFAULT~~

BAD IDEA:
Let `passengers=[]` rather than `passengers=None`, thus avoiding the `if` clause in the previous `__init__`.


```python
class hauntedBus:

    def __init__(self, passengers=[]):
        self.passengers = passengers

    def pick(self, name):
        self.passengers.append(name)

    def drop(self, name):
        self.passengers.remove(name)

```


```python
bus1 = hauntedBus(list('abcd'))
bus1.passengers
```




    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']




```python
bus1.pick('e')
bus1.drop('b')
bus1.passengers

# No problem here so far
```




    ['a', 'c', 'd', 'e']




```python
bus2 = hauntedBus()
bus2.pick('x')
bus2.passengers
```




    ['x']




```python
bus3 = hauntedBus()
bus3.passengers
```




    ['x']



PROBLEM: the default is no longer empty


```python
bus3.pick('y')
bus2.passengers
```




    ['x', 'y']



PROBLEM: bus3 picked up y and also appears in bus2


```python
hauntedBus.__init__.__defaults__
```




    (['x', 'y'],)




```python
hauntedBus.__init__.__defaults__[0] is bus2.passengers
```




    True



ATTENTION:
if a default value is a mutable object, any change will affect each future call of the function.

NOTE:
`None` is often used as the default value for parameters that may receive mutable values.
e.g.
```
def __init__(self, passengers=None):
        if passengers is None:
            self.passengers = []   # assign a new empty list to self.passengers
        else:
            self.passengers = list(passengers)

```


### Deal with mutable parameters


```python
class twilightBus:
    """A bus model that makes passengers vanish"""

    def __init__(self, passengers=None):
        if passengers is None:
            self.passengers = []
        else:
            self.passengers = passengers

    def pick(self, name):
        self.passengers.append(name)

    def drop(self, name):
        self.passengers.remove(name)
```


```python
basketball_team = list('abcde')
basketball_team
```




    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']




```python
bus = twilightBus(basketball_team)
```


```python
bus.drop('b')
bus.drop('c')
basketball_team
```




    ['a', 'd', 'e']



NOTE:
1. `self.passengers = passengers` makes `self.passengers` an alias for passengers
2. fix it with `self.passengers = list(passengers)`, should be initialized with a copy of `passengers` list
3. think twice before aliasing the argument object by simple assignment to an instance variable in the class
4. make a copy if doubt

## del and Garbage Collection

> Objects are never explicitly destroyed; however, when they become unreachable they may
be garbage-collected.

## Conclusion
1. Rebinding a variable doesn't change the object previously bound, if that variable was the last reference to the previous object, that object will be garbage collected.
2. Function parameters are passed as **aliases**, may change mutable object received as an argument.
    Thus make local copies or use immutable objects, like passing a tuple instead of a list.
3. `+=` or `*=` generates a brand new object for immutable objects, while may modify a mutable object in place.
